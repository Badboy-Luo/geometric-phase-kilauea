# Geometric Phase (Δη) Calculation

This folder contains scripts for computing and visualizing geometric phase changes (Δη) from temporal cross-correlation functions (CCFs). We directly provide calculated Δη in the 2018 analysis period.

## Contents
- `eta.py` – Python script to calculate Δη from temporal CCFs.
  - Generates `output` folder that contains computed Δη for all reference stations.
- `output` – Example folder generated by `eta.py`, containing precomputed Δη values ready for visualization. Each file corresponds to a reference station and a time window.  
    **Example:**
    - `05d_AHUD.npy` – Calculated time-frequency Δη values using `AHUD` as the reference station.  
    - `05d_AHUD.txt` – Corresponding time axis (time intervals) for the Δη values.  
- `plot.py` – Python script to visualize Δη results.  
  - Generates time-frequency plots and time series of Δη from the `output/` folder.  
- `tf_eta.jpg` – Example time-frequency plot generated by `plot.py`.  
- `eta_0.6Hz.pdf` – Example time-series figure generated by `plot.py`.  

## Requirements
